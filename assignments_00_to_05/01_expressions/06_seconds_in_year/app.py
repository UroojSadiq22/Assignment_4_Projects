# Use Python to calculate the number of seconds in a year, and tell the user what the result is in a nice print statement that looks like this (of course the value 5 should be the calculated number instead):

# There are 5 seconds in a year!

# You should use constants for this exercise -- there are 365 days in a year, 24 hours in a day, 60 minutes in an hour, and 60 seconds per minute.

hours_in_day: int = 24
minutes_in_hour: int = 60
seconds_in_minute: int = 60
seconds_in_year: int = days_in_year * hours_in_day * minutes_in_hour * seconds_in_minute

    print("\t")
